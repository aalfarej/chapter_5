"""
Write a function which is given an exam mark,
and it returns a string — the grade for that mark —
according to this scheme:
Mark    Grade
>= 90   Great
[80-90) Good
[70-80) OK
[60-70) Fair
[50-60) Needs Help
<50     Failing
The square and round brackets denote closed and open intervals.
A closed interval includes the number, and open interval excludes it.
So 49.99999 gets grade Failing, but 50 gets grade Needs Help. Assume:
grade_list = [83, 75, 74.9, 70, 69.9, 65, 60, 59.9, 55, 50, 49.9, 45, 44.9, 40, 39.9, 2, 0]
Test your function by printing the mark and the grade for all the elements in this list.
